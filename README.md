# Options Trading Analysis Tool

## Overview

Welcome to the Options Trading Analysis Tool! This project began as a simple options valuation tool designed to help traders assess the fair value of options contracts. However, as I worked through the project, it naturally evolved into a comprehensive analysis tool that provides deeper insights into options trading strategies, risk management, and market behavior.
